SHAHunt loads a set of (presumed) SHA-1 hashes from a file, and then iterates over the file trying to match plaintext chunks to one of the loaded hashes.  You can specify a lot of configuration in order to increase compatability with a variety of file types, such as file offsets to load the hashes, and offsets to start the iteration.  Run the program without any arguments to see some usage information.
     
Requires libxbox from xbox-linux CVS.
     
All settings are stored in a settings_t struct, so it would be easy to add support to save state on a break signal and the be able to load the settings back from a file.  If a serious need arised the program could also be converted to a distributed client/server model to distribute the load.  Email me if you have a need for this and we can work something out.
